# Overview

<br />

FlowUI is a React components library that is built on top of
[Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) and designed to work
seamlessly with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and the new Next.js
[App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app). This library provides
a comprehensive collection of customizable UI components that make
it easy to create beautiful and responsive web applications.

<br />

The components in FlowUI are designed to be highly modular, making it easy
to configure and customize them to fit the specific needs of an application.
This makes it possible to create unique and engaging user interfaces that
are tailored to the requirements of individual projects.

<br />

FlowUI is optimized for use with Next.js, which is a popular framework for
building server-rendered React applications. The library is fully compatible
with the new Next.js app directory, which provides a standardized structure
for organizing Next.js projects. This makes it easy to integrate the
components into an existing Next.js project and start building beautiful
user interfaces right away.

<br />

The components in FlowUI are also designed to be highly performant, ensuring
that applications built with the library are fast and responsive. The
library is built using modern web development best practices, such as lazy
loading and code splitting, to ensure that only the necessary components are
loaded when they are needed.

<br />

Overall, FlowUI is a powerful React components library that is built
specifically for use with Next.js and the new Next.js app directory. With
its comprehensive collection of customizable UI components and its focus on
performance, it is an excellent choice for building modern web applications
that are both beautiful and fast.
