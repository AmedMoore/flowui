# FlowUI - Quickstart

**FlowUI** is a library of components built to work seamlessly with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).
It utilizes [TailwindCSS](http://tailwindcss.com) and [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org)
to deliver visually-appealing, highly-performant, and fully-customizable components.

Learn how to get started by following this quickstart guide.

## Getting started

**FlowUI** is a _"plug and play"_ library; It can be integrated into your project as easily as
installing [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flowui/react) package and importing
the components you want to use.

### Installation

1. Install **FlowUI** as a dependency using NPM, Yarn or PNPM by running the following command:

   ```bash
   $ npm install @flowui/react
   ```

2. Use **FlowUI** as a `preset` in your `tailwind.config.js` file:

   ```js
   const flowUiConfig = require("@flowui/react/tailwind.config");

   module.exports = {
     presets: [flowUiConfig],
     // other TailwindCSS config...
   };
   ```

3. Import **FlowUI**'s styles to your project:

   In layout file

   ```tsx
   // your-layout-file.tsx
   import "@flowui/react/styles.css";
   ```

   In global style file

   ```scss
   // your-global-styles-file.css
   @import "@flowui/react/styles.css";
   ```

   <Alert title="Good to know" variant="flat" color="primary" customClassName="px-6 py-4">
     Note that in Next.js 13 (App Router) you can import global styles file from
     anywhere in your app.
   </Alert>

4. Import the components you want to use in your project:

   ```tsx
   import { Card, Text } from "@flowui/react";

   const MyComponent = () => (
     <Card shadow>
       <Text as="h1" size="xl">
         FlowUI is awesome!
       </Text>
     </Card>
   );
   ```

## Customization

**FlowUI** can be easily customized to your taste by overriding the TailwindCSS theme.
